One day, Harry Potato and Frosted Boba bump into each other and meet in a magical forest. While they are having conversations and introducing themselves, they get interrupted by Voldemort. Voldemort commands them to give them the "golden key".
Since Frosted Boba doesn't know what is going on, Harry Potato gets a flashback with Potato locking a vault with the golden sorcerer's stone with the "Golden Key". Harry Potato notices the chaos that would happen if Voldemort the "golden key" got into Voldemort's hands. Because of this thought, Harry Potato tells Frosted Boba to kill Voldemort. 
They successfully killed Voldemort and broke into his memory. The memory was of Apple liking Voldemort and helping him. They soon recruit Applestream and fly to Happylandâ€”however, the Happyland heroes, Supa Avocado, Agent Gummy Bear, and Glazed Guardian think that Potato is a villain because she is a vegetable. Then, everyone fights, but Harry Potato reveals she is not a villain. All of the foods stop fighting and help agree to find the "GOLDEN POTATO" which is their mission.

For this story (Episode 3), I have made the character, Harry Potato which is the character that tells everyone the mission and notices to kill Voldemort. My part of the story is that I have coded the story and made the dialogue.
In our story, we had amazing background music and sound effects that fit well in our story. In addition, we had characters that were in other stories.
The negative action that took part in this story was that our characters' design and editing weren't that clear.
