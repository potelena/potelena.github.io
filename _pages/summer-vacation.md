# My Summer Vacation

## Studying at JMK Academy

This summer vacation, my friends and I applied to an academy called **JMK** and studied **grammar** there. It was such a fun time! Every day, we had **IXL grammar challenges**, and the higher we placed, the more points we would earn.

## Trip to Cebu, Philippines 🇵🇭

After three weeks of studying, I traveled to **Cebu, Philippines** with my family. This was an **amazing trip** filled with exciting ocean activities:

- Parasailing 🌊
- Scuba diving 🤿
- Snorkeling 🐠

My sister and I laughed and had so much fun, while my mom was too scared to go in the water! We stayed at a hotel with a **super delicious buffet**, and we even fed some **stray dogs** with leftovers.

When we returned to Korea, our best friend **Anna Banana** came to visit! To celebrate, my friends and I had lots of:

- Playdates 🎲
- Fun activities 🎉
- A trip to **Oak Valley**

## Oak Valley Trip with Friends

Oak Valley is a great vacation place only 2 hours from Korea. While there, we:

- Swam 🏊‍♀️
- Played at home 🏠
- Filmed a short film 🎥
- Had a fireworks night 🎇

### A Night Adventure...

One big event happened late at night during the fireworks:  
My mom forgot the **house keys**, and we were **locked outside**! Everyone was scared, especially the kids. We had to go to the main center while the parents tried to solve the problem.  

Eventually, we got back in and ended the night playing games together.

## The End of Summer

After many fun days, it was finally time to say goodbye and go home. My mom and I just **chilled and relaxed** until school started again.
