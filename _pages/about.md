Hello! My name is Elena Choi. Despite all the nicknames I have, my favorite nickname, is Potato. My favorite hobby is to read books or play the piano. I have a lovely older sister that is in 11th Grade and my mom and my dad. I also have a British Short Hair cat with white fur and blue eyes named Ollie short for Oliver.
